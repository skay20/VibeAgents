- Use .agentic/adapters/UNIVERSAL.md as canonical source.
Bootstrap context:
- `.ai/context/RUNTIME_MIN.md`
- `.ai/context/BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `.ai/context/PROJECT.md`

## Compiled Universal Rules (Inline)
- Startup handshake must run in this order: bootstrap context -> orchestrator entrypoint -> PRD ingest -> single calibration -> dispatch -> execution.
- PRD intake is structure-based (not keyword-only) and updates `docs/PRD.md` managed block.
- Always resolve dispatch and write: `tier_decision.md`, `dispatch_signals.md`, `dispatch_resolution.md`, `planned_agents.md`.
- In implementation runs, do not omit `architect`, `qa_reviewer`, or `docs_writer`.
- Planned agents are not execution evidence; executed agents must emit metrics with `ok|blocked|failed`.
- Enforce flow gates with `scripts/enforce-flow.sh <run_id> <tier> pre_release|final`.
- In framework mode, refresh `Last-Generated` metadata for modified managed files before verify passes.

- Tool identifier: set `AGENTIC_TOOL=cursor`.
