# Quality Gates

Before declaring any task as "complete", you MUST run and pass all quality gates.

## Required Checks

1. **Tests**: `npm test`
   - All tests must pass
   - Coverage >= 80%

2. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
   - 0 errors
   - Warnings must be justified

3. **Type Check**: `npm run typecheck`
   - 0 TypeScript errors

4. **Build**: `npm run build`
   - Must complete successfully

## Output Format

When completing a task, report:

```
✅ Quality Gates:
   - Tests: PASS (X tests, Y% coverage)
   - Lint: PASS (0 errors)
   - Type Check: PASS (0 errors)
   - Build: PASS
```

## Enforcement

If any gate fails:
- DO NOT mark task as complete
- Fix the issues
- Re-run all gates
