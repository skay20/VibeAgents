# BOOTSTRAP (L0-min)

## Purpose
Provide minimal context for fast startup. Load only what is needed to begin safely.

## Load Order (Startup)
1. `.ai/context/BOOTSTRAP.md`
2. `.ai/context/PROJECT.md`
3. `.agentic/CONSTITUTION.md`
4. `docs/PRD.md` (only when planning or implementing)

## Rules
- Do not load L1 files unless required.
- If PRD is missing or placeholder, write questions and BLOCK.
